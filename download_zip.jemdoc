If for any reason you cannot download the code using GIT or you do not want to use GIT (this is not encouraged!), you can download the code in a zip archive

. current code from the *stable* branch [http://www.acadotoolkit.org/zip/acadotoolkit-current-stable.zip acadotoolkit-current-stable.zip] or
. current code from the *master* branch [http://www.acadotoolkit.org/zip/acadotoolkit-current-master.zip acadotoolkit-current-master.zip].

Those archives are automatically updated after each successfully compiled and tested commit we push to the GIT repository.
