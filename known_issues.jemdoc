= Known issues

A more complete list of issues can be found [https://github.com/acado/acado/issues /here/]. In the following list are some /blockers/ (a bit more serious ones):

- BDF integrator does not work in the *master* branch; since introduction of Eigen3 for linear algebra (LA). In particular, the functionality has been disabled since LA routines have to be rebased to Eigen3 -- this is missing.

- The *master* branch cannot be compiled on Windows with Visual Studio; the compiler complains about Eigen3 code (some overloaded functions). This consequently means that MATLAB interface cannot be compiled on Windows.
