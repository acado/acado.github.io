- The master branch is under some (heavy) dev.

- BDF integrator does not work in the master branch; since introduction of Eigen3 for linear algebra (LA). In particular, the functionality has been disabled since LA routines have to be rebased to Eigen3 -- this is missing.

- The master branch cannot be compiled on Windows with Visual Studio; the compiler complains about Eigen3 code (some overloaded functions). This consequently means that MATLAB interface cannot be compiled on Windows.
